We couldn't find a valid configuration file for this linting run.

This is the directory we were trying to lint: <%= directory %>

<% if (filesExamined && filesExamined.length) { %>These are the configuration files we examined:

<% filesExamined.forEach(function(file) { %>- <%= file %>
<% }); %>
None of these configuration files resulted in a valid configuration. Please
check each file and look for a potential JSON/YAML syntax error. For JavaScript
configuration files, please make sure that their configuration is exported by
assigning to module.exports. Alternatively, you can create a new configuration
file by running this command from your project root:

    eslint --init
<% } else { %>No potential configuration files were found. If you have not created a
configuration file, run this command from your project root to get started:

    eslint --init
<% } %>
If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint to chat with the team.
